# Termplot

**Beautiful plots in your terminal.**

## Overview

Termplot renders the most beautiful and advanced plots directly inside your
terminal by running a web app inside an ephemeral web browser, taking a
screenshot, and using modern escape codes to render the image.

## Installation

### Any Shell

In bash, zsh, or any other shell, you can install Termplot globally with npm:

```bash
npm install -g termplot.nu
```

However, this form of Termplot opens a new browser window for every call, making
plots render a bit slowly. You can render plots much faster by using the Nushell
plugin instead.

### Nushell Plugin

If you are in [Nushell](https://nushell.sh), you can access the advanced form of
Termplot that manages a browser automatically in the background.

Instead of simply installing `termplot` globally, you can install the plugin.

First, install Termplot in your project with [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/):

```nu
pnpm install termplot.nu
```

Then, add the Termplot plugin to your current Nushell environment:

```nu
plugin add node_modules/.bin/nu_plugin_termplot
```

Finally, you must "use" the plugin and source the Termplot script:

```nu
plugin use termplot
source node_modules/termplot.nu/termplot.nu
```

## Usage

### In Bash or Zsh

Simply pipe a Plotly configuration JSON file directly into Termplot in any
terminal that supports the iterm image protocol:

```bash
cat plotly-config.json | termplot
```

This will render the plot in your terminal.

You can see examples in [./examples](./examples).

Learn how to write Plotly configuration files in their
[documentation](https://plotly.com/javascript/).

### In Nushell

If you have followed the Nushell plugin installation instructions above, you can
pipe a Nushell value directory into Termplot. Do this by using the `open`
command in Nushell instead of the `cat` command. Termplot will manage the
browser window automatically, so that subsequent calls to Termplot will render
plots almost instantly.

```nu
open plotly-config.json | termplot
```

## Compatibility

Termplot only supports the iTerm image protocol, which works in iTerm2 and
WezTerm.

## Plotting Tools

Termplot currently only supports Plotly plots.

## How it Works

Termplot finds an open port, runs a React Router / express web app, runs a
[puppeteer](https://github.com/puppeteer/puppeteer) web browser, and navigates
to the web app, loading the desired plot, taking a screenshot of the plot,
rendering the screenshot in the terminal, and then exiting.

If using the Nushell plugin, Termplot will keep the browser and webapp open in
the background, so that subsequent calls to Termplot will render plots almost
instantly.

## Dependencies

These tools make Termplot possible:

- [plotly.js](https://github.com/plotly/plotly.js)
- [puppeteer](https://github.com/puppeteer/puppeteer)
- [express](https://github.com/expressjs/express)
- [react-router](https://github.com/remix-run/react-router)
- [ansi-escapes](https://github.com/sindresorhus/ansi-escapes)

## TODO

- [x] Cat files into termplot and render the images in iTerm2/Wezterm
- [x] Support config templates for easy plotting: See beautiful.nu
- [ ] Support png file output
- [ ] Support other image protocols for other terminals
- [ ] Support other plotting libraries
- [x] Nushell plugin to hold browser open for faster rendering
- [ ] Provide `serve` alternative for viewing interactive plots in a browser
