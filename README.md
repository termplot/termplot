## Introduction

The purpose of Termplot is to render the most beautiful and advanced plots
directly inside your terminal.

This comes at the cost of complexity, because in order to enable this, Termplot
bundles an entire web browser with a web server to take advantage of advanced
plotting tools that work on the web.
