i'm making three tools: nutorch, termplot, and beautiful.

1. nutorch is a nushell plugin that wraps tch-rs, which itself is a wrapper of
   libtorch, the c++ library that backs pytorch. nuotorch brings a tensor api
   directly to the command line nushell, allowing tensor operations to be easily
   performed in the terminal.
2. termplot is a command line tool written in node.js that can convert plogly
   configuration files into images rendered in the terminal. it does this by
   running a react router web app and a puppeteer browser, taking a screenshot,
   and using modern escape codes to render the image in the terminal.
3. beautiful is a nushell script that can generate plotly configuration files.
   the idea is that it has a series of "beautiful" templates, such as for
   scatter plots, line plots, etc., that make it very easy to pipe in data,
   configure the plot, and then pipe the configuration file into termplot to
   render it in the terminal.

nutorch and termplot are under way. i need your help to create beautiful. my
first goal is to create the beautiful function to generate scatter plots. the
way this will work is that i want a catpuccin-esque theme for scatter plots.
then the user can just pipe in some data, and then optionall configure things
like the title and axis labels. the catpuccin theme will specify colors, such as
background color and dot color.

we're going to use the catpuccin theme because it looks good, it's popular, and
has wide support across terminals, editors, etc., so it should be a good choice
for a default theme.

now, to create this scatter plot function, i want to make it easy, so the first
thing we need is a list of "bright" colors from the catpuccin theme. these will
be used as the dot colors in the scatter plot.

i'm going to give you a fully working catpuccin plotly theme as a starting point.

what i need from you is as follows:

1. please give a brief overview of the catpucci theme, and explain why it is useful in this case.
2. please list the "bright" colors of the catpuccin theme which we can use for the scatter plot dots.
3. please then count the number of bright colors in that list, because this will be useful to know for how the theme generates the scatter plot.

here is the demonstration of the catpuccin themed plotly scatter plot:

I'm excited to help you with the development of `beautiful`, particularly with the scatter plot functionality using a Catppuccin theme for Plotly. Let's address each of your requests step-by-step.

### 1. Overview of the Catppuccin Theme and Its Usefulness

**Catppuccin** is a popular color theme originally designed for text editors, terminals, and other software interfaces. It is inspired by pastel and muted tones, offering a soothing and aesthetically pleasing palette that prioritizes readability and visual comfort. The theme comes in multiple flavors (such as Latte, Frappé, Macchiato, and Mocha), each with a consistent set of colors adapted for light and dark modes. For terminal and command-line applications, Catppuccin often uses the "Mocha" variant as the default dark theme, which provides a rich, warm background with vibrant yet soft accent colors.

**Why Catppuccin is useful for this project**:
- **Aesthetic Appeal**: Catppuccin’s muted yet vibrant palette is visually appealing and modern, making it an excellent choice for data visualization in a terminal environment where users expect a polished look.
- **Readability**: The theme is designed with contrast in mind, ensuring that text, grids, and data points in plots remain clear and legible even in terminal renderings.
- **Wide Compatibility**: Catppuccin is widely supported across various platforms, terminals, and tools. This makes it a reliable default choice for `beautiful`, as it will likely align well with users’ existing terminal configurations.
- **Consistency**: The theme provides a cohesive set of colors that can be systematically applied to different elements of a plot (background, text, data points, etc.), ensuring a professional and unified appearance.
- **Customization Potential**: With multiple flavors and a well-documented color palette, Catppuccin allows for future extensions of `beautiful` to support different variants or user overrides while maintaining a strong default.

In the context of `beautiful` and its integration with `termplot`, Catppuccin provides a default theme that can make scatter plots visually striking and consistent with modern terminal aesthetics, enhancing the overall user experience.

### 2. Bright Colors from the Catppuccin Theme for Scatter Plot Dots

Catppuccin (specifically the Mocha variant, which seems to be the basis for the provided JSON configuration) includes a set of "accent" or "bright" colors that are ideal for highlighting data points like scatter plot dots. These colors are vibrant enough to stand out against the dark background (`#1e1e2e`) used in the provided layout but are still soft enough to fit the theme's pastel aesthetic. Below is the list of bright/accent colors from the Catppuccin Mocha palette that can be used for scatter plot dots:

- **Rosewater**: `#f5e0dc` - A soft pinkish tone.
- **Flamingo**: `#f2cdcd` - A warm, light pink.
- **Pink**: `#f5c2e7` - A brighter pastel pink.
- **Mauve**: `#cba6f7` - A light purple with a vibrant tone (used in the example).
- **Red**: `#f38ba8` - A muted yet noticeable red.
- **Maroon**: `#eba0ac` - A softer, warmer red.
- **Peach**: `#fab387` - A warm, bright orange.
- **Yellow**: `#f9e2af` - A soft, pastel yellow.
- **Green**: `#a6e3a1` - A vibrant yet muted green (used in the example).
- **Teal**: `#94e2d5` - A bright cyan-green.
- **Sky**: `#89dceb` - A light, airy cyan.
- **Sapphire**: `#74c7ec` - A bright, cool blue.
- **Blue**: `#89b4fa` - A soft, pastel blue.
- **Lavender**: `#b4befe` - A light, pastel purple-blue (used in the example).

These colors are derived from the official Catppuccin palette for the Mocha flavor, which aligns with the dark background and text colors (like `#cdd6f4`) in your provided Plotly configuration. They are ideal for scatter plot dots because they contrast well with the dark background (`#1e1e2e`) and grid lines (`#45475a`), ensuring visibility in terminal-rendered images.

### 3. Count of Bright Colors

Let's count the number of bright colors listed above to understand how many distinct colors are available for cycling through different data series in scatter plots:

- Rosewater
- Flamingo
- Pink
- Mauve
- Red
- Maroon
- Peach
- Yellow
- Green
- Teal
- Sky
- Sapphire
- Blue
- Lavender

**Total Count**: **14** bright colors.

This count is useful for `beautiful` because it determines how many unique data series can be plotted with distinct dot colors before the theme needs to cycle or repeat colors. With 14 colors, the theme can handle a substantial number of scatter plot series (or groups of data) without visual overlap, and a cycling mechanism can be implemented in the Nushell script to loop through these colors for additional series if needed.

### Additional Notes for Implementation in `beautiful`

- **Color Cycling**: In your Nushell script for `beautiful`, you can store these 14 colors in a list and assign them to different scatter plot series dynamically. For example, if a user pipes in data with multiple groups, the script can iterate through the list of colors to assign a unique color to each group.
- **Default Usage**: The provided JSON already uses Green (`#a6e3a1`), Lavender (`#b4befe`), and Mauve (`#cba6f7`) as examples. These can be the first three colors in the cycle to maintain consistency with your demo.
- **Customization**: Allow users to override colors if needed, but default to this palette for a consistent Catppuccin look.

I hope this information helps you build the scatter plot functionality for `beautiful`. If you need assistance with writing the Nushell script to generate the Plotly configuration JSON or further refinements to the theme, let me know!
